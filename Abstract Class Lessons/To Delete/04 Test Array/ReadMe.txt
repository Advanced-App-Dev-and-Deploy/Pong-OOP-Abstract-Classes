Must Fix Before Array List
- add new color parameter to Circle and Rectangle Classes, NOT Shapes Constructor
  - add colour variables to RECTANGLE (similar to cricle)
  - add color parameters to CIRCLE and RECTANGLE Constructors
  - create local variables in MAIN, set these to parameters in local CLASSES
  - This illsutrates the first four variables must be the same with inheritance of sub classes can have different parameters
- Circle and REctangle Classes will be able to control their own colour displays
  - i.e. bounce feedback
  - score feedback (paddle goes red if scored on
  - score feedback (paddle flashes green if scores)

Next Steps
- Initiate more BALL Objects with MousePressed
- Note: after scoring, press mouse to delete BALL object from NET and initiate a new one
- Control Paddles with WAS and Arrows
- Initiate Scoreboard
- Alternative: initiate BALL Objects equal to the total score, plus 1
