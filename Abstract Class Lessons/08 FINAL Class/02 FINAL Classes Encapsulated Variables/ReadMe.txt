Organize the different classes with EXTENDING & FINAL
- Attending to variables being inherited
- Naming helps with human reading
  Note: repeats how classes might be related

Note: attending to the constructor parameters
- easy to increase number
- if decreasing, simply repeat the variable (i.e. super(x,y,ptX,ptX) )
