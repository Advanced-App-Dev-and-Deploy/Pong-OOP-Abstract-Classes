# Pong OOP Abstract Classes
Lessons for Pong

TBA & UNDERCONSTRUCTION

# To Include

Vocabulary
- Abstract Class
- Abstract Method
- Dynamic Binding (or late binding): during runtime an overridden method is classed depending on which subclass is called
- Inheritance: subclass is created from superclass by absorbing the states and behaviors (variables and methods)

# To Include: Abstract Class Pong Progressions

CAUTION: we are starting another Pong Program from a blank sketch
- I know ... super exciting
- Great News ... you have all the code worked out already from Procedural Pong, Pong OOP, and Developed Classes Pong (Metaphors)

Pong works with only shapes and movements: excellent teaching tool for abstract classes

Introduction to Abstract Classes
- Creating a Super and Sub Class
- Variables and Methods must be declared in advanced (inheritance)
- Creating Objects with an Abstract Class
- Note: must create "Bruh, turn your Phun!" instruction to CANVAS, confirm in console, and must break the app if started in portrait mode

Purpose:
- create a ball that moves and bounces off the ceiling and bottom
- also gets stuck in a very small net (thus very large paddles to start this project)
- extra large paddles (unique to this assignment only) bounce ball (note: when drawing ball, send paddle coordinates)

Introduction to Array List of Abstract Class: compiling Pong by drawing each shape, one at a time and doing all the math
- Identifying parts of the GUI that are meaningful in the game
  - Example: Pong Ball is always spawned in from the middle of the field
  - Example: Firework Ball drawing and arithmetic is stopped when y-value of all objects is greater than Height of Geometry
- Using setup() to create objects and store them in Global Array List
- Using Local Classes and Objects to transfer values into Abstract Array List
- Using local vs. global to deal with system resources
- Introduce basic methods for Array Lists

CAUTION: to start the Array List has 3 elements (ball, left paddle, right paddle)

A data structure will categorize additional elements
- Note: Rectangle Class is able to draw text (scoreboard, instructions)
- Rectangle: Left Paddle  
- Rectangle: Right Paddle
- Rectangle: Left Score Board (Pong Ball stuck on Right Side)
- Rectangle: Right Score Board
- Ellipse: Pong Ball
- Ellipse: any additional pong ball objects
- Ellipse: any additional ellipse like objects

### Future Ideas
